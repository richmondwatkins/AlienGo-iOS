I&amp;#39;m now learning just how screwey all of the property laws are. We just found out the hard way that a conservator of an estate &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; give away property as a gift. Meaning...the house my aunt (grandpa&amp;#39;s conservator) gave to my parents...isn&amp;#39;t really theirs. So now the house in a weird limbo where my parents&amp;#39; names are on the property, but it&amp;#39;s actually willed to my crazy ass grandmother who will probably lose it in a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juuuuust...fuck man.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The people complaining would never be able to afford those whether foreigners were able to buy or not. It seems like the province needs to ensure adequate social housing. Would you agree with this? My analogy would be similar to that the average person can&amp;#39;t afford a BMW. That is fine as BMW&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t meant to be sold to literally every single person; however, there many cheaper alternatives. Right now, people are only building luxury houses because the margins are high, it is up to the province to ensure there is enough adequate social housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
